# Array Method Challenges
## forEach

Write a function that uses the `Array.prototype.forEach()` & the `Array.prototype.push()` methods within it.
Using the forEach method, loop over all of the presidents from our presidents array.
Then, push the president's last name and the year they were born to a new array as individual objects containing key/value pairs of each residents last name and date of birth.
Then, return the new array from the function.
