# jsChallenges

a collection of challenges for JS / web dev.

These are organized by topic folders. Until v1.0 (when this goes public), feel free to add new challenges within a topic or a new topic entirely.


## Format

Instead of .js files with comments, you can write markdown files with code, which render well on GitHub and elsewhere. You can do a code block in markdown by enclosing it in three backticks. Immediately after the opening backticks, write "js" to mark it as JS syntax for highlighting purposes. Example:

```js
import 'somelibrary';
let xs = new Set([1,2,3]);
console.log(document);
```



## To-do

- [ ] import existing challenges
- [ ] write longer README for when/if students access these
