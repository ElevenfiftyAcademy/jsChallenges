# jsChallenges

a collection of challenges for JS / web dev.

These are organized by topic folders. Until v1.0 (when this goes public), feel free to add new challenges within a topic or a new topic entirely.

To-do:

- [ ] import existing challenges
- [ ] write longer README for when/if students access these
