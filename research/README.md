# Reseach Challenges

These files contain topics organized around some larger topic.
Instead of a coding challenge, you can have students research these topics, either individually or in groups, and then have mini-presentations on each topic.
(Or feel free to use them in whatever way works for your class.)

Please add to these lists if you have your own ideas for good topics!
